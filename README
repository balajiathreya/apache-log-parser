To create log files with random data, use the following command:
    python createfiles.py 1 <some_file_name>
    python createfiles.py 2 <a_different_file_name>

Each run produces a file with 10,000 entries. If you specify the same file name, it will just append data to existing data. For ex, to create a file named "file1" with format 1 and containing 60,000 entries, type
    python createfiles.py 1 file1
    6 times

Once, you have enough files, run python yapta.py <file_name> <file_name> <file_name>...

The script will generate .out files containing a list of user ids that satisfy the requirement.

To run the test cases, type 
    python testcase.py.

The functions in the script simply write to a file, so I was not sure how you wanted the test cases to be(It may appear a little convoluted).

I would be happy to discuss the implementation.

Thanks!
